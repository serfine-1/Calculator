# 🎉 Welcome to the Fun Calculator! 🎉

# We're using 'float()' to make sure our numbers can have decimals too. Fancy, right? ✨
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))

# Same trick here—using 'float()' for decimal magic! 🧙‍♂️
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Add the two numbers (Yay! Addition is the first step to fun!) ➕
sum_result = num1 + num2

# Subtract the second number from the first (Negative vibes, but necessary! 😜) ➖
difference_result = num1 - num2

# Multiply the two numbers (More bang for your buck! 💥) ✖️
product_result = num1 * num2

# We'll assume the user is being responsible and not dividing by zero for now!
quotient_result = num1 / num2

# Step 4: Show the user what we got! 🥳 Time for the big reveal! 🎉
print(f"Results of your two numbers:")
print(f"Sum: {sum_result}")  # ➕
print(f"Difference: {difference_result}")  # ➖
print(f"Product: {product_result}")  # ✖️
print(f"Quotient: {quotient_result}")  # ➗

# 🏁 And that's it! You've just made a mini-calculator! 😎💻
